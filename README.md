# Minebots - Evolved Simulated Agents in pybullet
This repository contains the code and documentation for my project focused on evolving and simulating robots using fitness functions in PyBullet. The project explores the capabilities of simulated robots in a controlled environment, providing a platform for experimenting with various types of robots and their performance.

The simulation environment utilizes PyBullet, a powerful physics simulation library, to create a realistic and interactive environment for the evolved robots. By defining fitness functions, the project aims to guide the evolutionary process and optimize the performance of the simulated robots.

The repository includes different types of evolved robots for experimentation. This includes quadrupedal robots that exhibit locomotion using four legs, as well as gliding robots that utilize coded aerodynamic forces to glide through the air. The gliding robots demonstrate the integration of aerodynamic principles into the simulation for achieving controlled gliding.

To use the repository, simply clone it to your local machine and follow the provided installation instructions. Once set up, you can run the main script to initiate the simulation and observe the evolved robots in action.
